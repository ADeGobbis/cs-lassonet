# Compressed Sensing LassoNet

This project is a branch of [this master](https://github.com/lasso-net/lassonet).
At the moment, we support fully connected feed-forward neural networks.
LassoNet is based on the work presented in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12207).
The code was used for this [conference paper](https://zenodo.org/records/7612980).
